## ... porting OpenFIRE-firmware for EPS32

Questo repository è un porting del progetto originale 'OpenFIRE-firmware' del TeamOpenFIRE, adattato per funzionare sul microcontrollore ESP32S3.
Il progetto è stato sviluppato utilizzando PlatformIO e, salvo alcuni adattamenti e piccole modifiche, il codice rimane sostanzialmente fedele all'originale del TeamOpenFIRE.
Ho inoltre implementato la connessione wireless utilizzando il protocollo ESP-NOW per ESP32. Per farlo, ho sviluppato un dongle ESP32S3 da collegare al PC, il cui codice è disponibile nel mio repository 'OpenFIRE-DONGLE-ESP32'.
Grazie a questa soluzione, il PC non rileva alcuna differenza tra la connessione diretta via USB e quella wireless tramite dongle.
Il codice di questo repository funziona anche sul microcontrollore RP2040, ma in questo caso supporta solo il collegamento diretto tramite USB, senza connessione wireless.
Ogni volta che verranno apportate modifiche al progetto originale 'OpenFIRE-firmware' del TeamOpenFIRE, aggiornerò di conseguenza anche il codice di questo repository.
Ringrazio di cuore il TeamOpenFIRE per la creazione del progetto 'OpenFIRE-firmware': a loro vanno tutti i meriti e la mia piena gratitudine.
Questo è semplicemente un adattamento per il funzionamento su ESP32S3, con l'aggiunta della connessione wireless tramite ESP-NOW.


This repository is a porting of the original 'OpenFIRE-firmware' project by TeamOpenFIRE, adapted to work on the ESP32S3 microcontroller.
The project was developed using PlatformIO and, apart from some adaptations and small adjustments, the code remains essentially faithful to the original by TeamOpenFIRE.
I have also implemented wireless connectivity using the ESP-NOW protocol for ESP32. To achieve this, I developed an ESP32S3 dongle to connect to the PC, and its code is available in my repository 'OpenFIRE-DONGLE-ESP32'.
Thanks to this solution, the PC does not detect any difference between a direct USB connection and a wireless connection via dongle.
The code in this repository also works on the RP2040 microcontroller, but in this case, it only supports direct USB connection without wireless connectivity.
Whenever there are changes to the original 'OpenFIRE-firmware' project by TeamOpenFIRE, I will adapt the code in this repository accordingly.
I sincerely thank TeamOpenFIRE for creating the 'OpenFIRE-firmware' project; all credit and gratitude go to them for their work.
This is simply an adaptation to make it work on ESP32S3, with the addition of wireless connectivity via ESP-NOW.

###### *Dedicated tutorials for the OpenFIRE system to come eventually.
 
***Refer to [BOARDS.md](docs/BOARDS.md) for default pinouts for various boards** - though keep in mind that every board supports completely custom pin layouts, configurable through the OpenFIRE Desktop App. These layouts can also be viewed from the new Desktop App.*

## Installation:
Grab the latest *.UF2* binary for your respective board [from the releases page](https://github.com/TeamOpenFIRE/OpenFIRE-Firmware/releases/latest), and drag'n'drop the file to your microcontroller while booted into Bootloader mode; the RP2040 is automatically mounted like this when no program is loaded, but it can be forced into this mode by holding BOOTSEL while plugging it into the computer - it will appear as a removable storage device called **RPI-RP2**.

## Additional information
[Check out the enclosed instruction book!](src/README.md) For developers, consult [the documentation on setting up and building the OpenFIRE Firmware.](docs/COMPILING.md)

## Known Issues:
- With Pico W & Bluetooth enabled, TinyUSB/Serial fails to initialize properly when connected via USB, so the firmware is deadlocked either sending serial or USB report data.
- Updating NeoPixels settings from the OF App might cause some Pixels to be locked or shut off after saving - this is only temporary and will resolve itself after unplugging the board.
- Some rare instances where a serial exit signal is received while sending an escape key signal in the Simple Pause Menu with (non-static) Pixels in use might cause the gun to freeze. The exact cause is being investigated.

## TODO:
- Come up with better jokes.

> [!NOTE]
> Solenoid *may* cause EMI disconnects with too thin of wiring. Cables for this run specifically should be **24AWG** at its thinnest - or else the cables will become antennas under extended use, which will trip USB safety thresholds in your PC to protect the ports.

## Regarding Contributions, Ports & Forks:
Being an open source project, OpenFIRE **invites anyone to contribute** new code or fixes, assuming the following guidelines are followed:
 - To expedite review, PRs modifying existing code **must** describe the reasoning behind the changes (e.g. *"this resolves an issue regarding building on..."*). Default or *no* description text in the PR is likely to prompt for more details, or your request may be closed without merging.
 - Any work that modifies more than a few lines or files at once **should be performed on a separate branch** on your local repository, so that PRs don't go out-of-scope from simultaneous ongoing development.

OpenFIRE uses the Arduino format for the main source file `OpenFIREmain.ino` which should make it easier to develop for other architectures, however the `arduino-pico` core does use some of its own keywords/syntax (e.g. for establishing multi core workloads) so it won't directly run on other platforms without modification. While this repo is primarily focused on development for RP2040/RP235X ARM platforms, **we do encourage those with the know-how to port OpenFIRE to other architectures or microcontrollers.** Ideally, any ports should maintain compatibility with the existing Desktop App so the user doesn't need multiple executables. Those who are interested in maintaining these forks are encourage to write in a new thread in the *Discussions* tab of this repository.

**Forks made for the purposes of rebranding are heavily DISCOURAGED.** All forks should maintain the OpenFIRE name as well as credits to its original authors (specifically *That One Seong,* *Samuel Ballantyne (Samco),* and *Mike Lynch (Prow7)*).

Products that wish to integrate OpenFIRE by using its firmware on a supported microcontroller board - for example, inside of a prebuilt light gun - should make its usage of OpenFIRE clear, as well as give appropriate credit to its original creators. While it is Free (Libre) Software, we do ask that anyone incorporating our volunteer work into a product to please consider contributing back to the project via donations or sponsorships. Usage of OpenFIRE in commercial environments (such as public arcade settings) is also allowed, with the same note about contributing back applying as well. Any inquiries regarding third-party commercial sales of OpenFIRE-enabled products (such as prebuilt light guns using its Firmware) should be discussed in a thread in the *Discussions* tab of this repository, or emailing *That One Seong (SeongsSeongs@gmail.com)* and/or *Samuel Ballantyne (samuelballantyne@hotmail.com).*

As written under the *GNU Lesser General Public License,* any entities that wish to incorporate part of or all of OpenFIRE's Firmware components **must make their modifications available to the public upon request.** OpenFIRE is ***Free Software,*** both as in *Libre* and as in *Coffee:* if you have been charged any amount to use OpenFIRE, **you have been scammed and should demand your money back!**
